Past Work Projects

Several projects here are from previous employers. As such, necessary compontents may not be included, and certain pertinent (NDA-protected or private) information may have been swept clean from the files. However general functionality code should remain.

Each directory is listed in chronological order, meaning the newest (and most pertinent) projects will have the higher number values.

The files in this repository are NOT for public use, but merely for demonstration of code. If you wish to obtain additional information about these files, please contact me: david.a.lucio@gmail.com

June 1, 2019 >>> Migrated DM Dashboard and API directories


## Project 4
/** Project 4 -- DM Dashboard Tool **/

This is a personal project I've started working on, in order to facilitate interactivity between Twitch streams and my D&D games. Presently, it includes very basic components. Aside from specific JS libraries and Bootstrap, the rest of the code is mine:

    • PHP Backend
    • RESTful PHP API
    • HTML/CSS/JS forms
    • AJAX for API calls

The ultimate goal is to build out a stream extension, include OAUTH, expand the API, and then streamline usert experience. Afterward, I'll work on replacing bootstrap with my own SASS framework for responsive use.


/** Project 3 -- Landing Page Builder **/

A dynamic landing page creation tool, meant for non-developers to be able to quickly make branded marketing campaigns without dev oversight. Pages created through the tool would be responive, include Eloqua form injection and validation, and adhere to Getty Images & iStockPhoto design standards. This subdirectory is not completely up-to-date.


/** Project 2 -- Sock Module **/
Feedback Module created for dev.windows.com


/** Project 1 -- Paywall **/
Paymeter / story tracking system created for Seattle Times
