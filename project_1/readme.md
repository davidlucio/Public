/** PROJECT 1 - Seattle Times Paymeter **/

This project was built on Backbone.js, along with jQuery and a JSON configuration file. It requires additional, internal site components from Seattle Times in order to function properly. Modifications of the configuration and components were done within a Wordpress CMS (and a plugin that I did not create, so I have not included).
