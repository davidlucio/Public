/** PROJECT 1 - Seattle Times Paymeter **/

This project was built using jQuery and WinJS. The custom.css stylesheet applis to HTML (not yet listed) for the entire page, including responsive styling. However the bottom portion of the file pertains specifically to the feedback mechanism.

It requires additional components that are only available through Harmony (internal source control), and are protected for the time being.
